1. Functionlity & Correctness

  The baseline implementation in in the `baseline` folder
  In general, only `client_grpc.cpp` and `server.cpp` are interesting. (`client.cpp` contains some glue code to glue grpc and fuse together)
  In client_grpc.cpp, you will see a `GRPCClient` class which contains all client fuse operation implementations in the name of `c_{operation}`
  Similarly you can find the server implementation in the `gRPCServiceImpl` class in `server.cpp`.
  The main function of `server.cpp` and the constructor of `GRPCClient` implements the initialization and crash recovery procedure.

To compile the code:
 Prerequisite:
  libfuse, libssl, cmake >= 3.15, a recent version of c++ compiler that support at least c++20
 On ubuntu 20.04:
  sudo apt install libfuse-dev libssl-dev cmake g++
 Compile command:
  cmake . && make -j

To run the code:
  ./server 0.0.0.0:12345 ./server_folder
  mkdir cache mount_point
  ./client 127.0.0.1:12345 ./cache -f ./mount_point

To test the htop compilation workload
  sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev autotools-dev autoconf build-essential
  cd server_folder
  tar zxvf 3.1.2.tar.gz #cannot do it in fuse due to lack of symlink
  ./autogen.sh #cannot do it in fuse due to lack of truncate
  ./configure #cannot do it in fuse due to lack of chmod
  cd ../mount_point
  make
  ./htop


2. Measurement
2.1 Performance

baseline, no_consistency

2.2 Reliability
Modified code to run this part can be find in the `reliability` folder

2.2.1 Normal functioning test:
Copy 1 file to another 
(used for testing client and server crash scenarios, test present in test_folder/test.cpp)
Run test with ./test

Run server with: 	 ./server ${localhost}:${server_port} ./server_folder 0

Run client with: 	ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAME_OPEN=0 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_DURING_WRITE=0 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAMING_DIRTY_FILE=0 PRINT_LOG=1 ./client ${localhost}:${client_port} ./ -f ./mnt

2.2.2 Client Crash (relevant code if found in client_grpc.cc)
Run server with: 	./server ${localhost}:${server_port} ./server_folder 0

Case 1:
Run client with:	ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAME_OPEN=1 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_DURING_WRITE=0 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAMING_DIRTY_FILE=0 PRINT_LOG=1 ./client ${localhost}:${client_port} ./ -f ./mnt

Case 2:
Run client with: 	ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAME_OPEN=0 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_DURING_WRITE=1 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAMING_DIRTY_FILE=0 PRINT_LOG=1 ./client ${localhost}:${client_port} ./ -f ./mnt

Case 3:
Run client with: 	ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAME_OPEN=0 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_DURING_WRITE=0 ENV_CLIENT_CRASH_BEFORE_RENAMING_DIRTY_FILE=1 PRINT_LOG=1 ./client ${localhost}:${client_port} ./ -f ./mnt

2.2.3 Server Crash


Case 1:
Run Server with : ./server 127.0.0.1:11225 ./server_folder 1

Case 2:
Run Server with : ./server 127.0.0.1:11225 ./server_folder 2

Case 3: 
Run Server normally : ./server 127.0.0.1:11225 ./server_folder 0
